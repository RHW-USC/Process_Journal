# Process Journal
## 1.1 Introduction

This process journal will be documenting the design and creation of a project for tasks 2 and 3 in DES220. The project itself, will be a responsive, and physical creation that will use a micro controller (Such as, a Raspberry Pi, ESP32, or a Micro:Bit).

## 1.2 Overall Design Considerations

Throughout this course, several key design areas are identified to increase design focus and productivity. These aspects identify the <b>Form</b>, <b>Interaction Configuration</b>, <b>What Input is Being Responded to?</b>, and <b>What kind of output does it respond with?</b>

A provided tool to help develop my brainstorming skills was the 'Responsive Roulette' tool in Week 6's Workshop. This tool generates several random answers for the different design aspects mentioned above. I was tasked with creating a 'solution' for this random combination to help me learn to think outside the box. The generated prompts I was given was the following.

### Generation #1

<b>Form:</b> Mobile App<br>
<b>Interaction Configuration:</b> Multiperson<br>
<b>What Input is being responded to?</b> Location<br>
<b>What kind of output does it respond with?</b> Visual

An idea for this, is an hide and seek mobile application that hiders install to see where the other hiders are hiding, and where the seeker is. Of course, everyone's location would be tracked using the app, and their location would be displayed using a generic map API like google maps, with hiders location marked with a blue pin, and the seeker in red.

### Generation #2
